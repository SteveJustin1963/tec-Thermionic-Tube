# tec-Thermionic-Tube
tec1 using and testing thermionic tubes or thermionic valves
- Open or shorted filaments can be detected using a multimeter
- plate resistance
- harmonic tests
- distortion tests with different anode loads, when overdriven, also rises when tube’s emission falls, due to aging
- emission 
- gas leaks, by measuring the change in plate current when a resistor is added to the grid circuit. The grid current caused by ionized gas molecules will raise the grid voltage when the resistor is in place, which can be detected as an increase in plate current.
- transconductance (the change in plate current per unit change in grid voltage). measured at a single operating point. 
- To match at a variety operating points, use curve tracer - tube testers that display plate current vs. plate voltage at different grid voltage steps 
- gain is measured at one operating point only, but this is adequate for tube matching in less-critical circuit positions
- noise and microphony allows you to listen through headphones/ see noise level on VU meter; to sort tubes least to most noise for phono/input/driver/output stage, preamps, integrated or power amps.  
- microphonics; act as a microphone; can hear an audible “clunk” or “ring” when tapping tube when amp/preamp is on
- matching tubes performance; push-pull amplifier output stages, in differential (balanced) circuits, and in outputs that use parallel devices. 
- The quality of a tube amplifier's output transformer is extremely important. Since it is expensive to build a high-quality transformer, any attempt to cut cost there could seriously undermine the amplifier's sound. This is especially true for single-ended amplifiers, since an air gap in the transformer is needed to prevent transformer core saturation, which would cause audible distortion and other problems. 
 
 

### tubes very high power / very high frequencies:
- Microwave ovens (magnetrons)
- Radars and radar jammers (thyratrons, pulsed triodes and tetrodes, magnetrons, klystrons, crossed-field amplifiers, traveling wave tubes)
- Radio transmitters (triodes and tetrodes),
- TV transmitters (tetrodes, klystrons and klystrodes)
- Satellite up- and downlinks (traveling wave tubes)
- Radiofrequency heating and welding in industry (triodes and magnetrons)
- Medical imaging such as x-rays and computer tomography (x-ray tubes), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; tetrodes and triodes). Radiation therapy might use x-ray tubes
- RF generators in fusion research and particle accelerators (triodes, tetrodes, klystrons, thyratrons, klystrodes)
- And then, of course, there are audio amplifiers, because they sound less harsh if overdriven. (Softer clipping).
- electron microscopes,
- older TV or CRO (cathode ray oscilloscope) set that used a Cathode Ray Tube,   https://www.quora.com/What-devices-still-use-vacuum-tubes
