tec1 using and testing thermionic tubes or thermionic valves
- harmonic tests
- distortion tests

"Most of the following applications are based on the ability of tubes to provide very high power at very high frequencies:
- Microwave ovens (magnetrons)
- Radars and radar jammers (thyratrons, pulsed triodes and tetrodes, magnetrons, klystrons, crossed-field amplifiers, traveling wave tubes)
- Radio transmitters (triodes and tetrodes),
- TV transmitters (tetrodes, klystrons and klystrodes)
- Satellite up- and downlinks (traveling wave tubes)
- Radiofrequency heating and welding in industry (triodes and magnetrons)
- Medical imaging such as x-rays and computer tomography (x-ray tubes), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; tetrodes and triodes). Radiation therapy might use x-ray tubes
- RF generators in fusion research and particle accelerators (triodes, tetrodes, klystrons, thyratrons, klystrodes)
- And then, of course, there are audio amplifiers, because they sound less harsh if overdriven. (Softer clipping).
